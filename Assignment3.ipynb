    "Ans. A constructor of a class in Python is defined using the __init__ method. The python __init__ is a reserved method in Python that behaves like any other member function of the class, except the statements written under its definition are used to initialize the data members of a class in Python, i.e. it basically contains assignment statements. he python __init__ method is declared within a class and is used to initialize the attributes of an object as soon as the object is formed. While giving the definition for an __init__(self) method, a default parameter, named ‘self’ is always passed in its argument. This self represents the object of the class itself. Like in any other method of a class, in case of __init__ also ‘self’ is used as a dummy object variable for assigning values to the data members of an object. "
